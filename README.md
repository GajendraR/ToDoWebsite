## Project Description

In this project, we will be creating a **Complete Todo Application** with all essential features, including CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The app is built using **React.js** for the frontend and **Redux** for state management. Additionally, we will add simple animations using **Framer Motion** to enhance user experience.

This project is beginner-friendly and aims to teach you key concepts like state management, component design, and animations in React.

## Key Features
- Add, Edit, and Delete Todo items
- Mark Todos as completed
- Filter Todos (All, Completed, Pending)
- State management using Redux
- Smooth animations using Framer Motion
